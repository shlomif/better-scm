<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
Mercurial is one of the two distributed SCM projects that were started
in response to the end of the availability of BitKeeper to open source
projects.  It was designed with the intention of being small, easy to
use, and highly scalable.
</p>

<p>
Although Mercurial was initially taken up by a subset of the Linux
kernel development community, it has since seen wider use both by open
source projects and companies.
</p>

<p>
The primary strengths of Mercurial are its simplicity and speed.  Even
though it has a very different conceptual model than CVS and
Subversion, its command line interface is similar enough that picking
it up just takes a few minutes.  Because it was targeted specifically
for work on large repositories, Mercurial is in many cases the fastest
SCM tool available.
