        <h1>Problems in the BitKeeper Gratis License</h1>
        <p>
        This is an excerpt from Rick Moen's 
        <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Apps/vcs.html">Version-Control and 
            SCMs for Linux</a> document
        in regard to the problems that were encountered in the BitKeeper 
        Gratis License. (which was end-of-lifed as of April 2005)
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Was encumbered by mandatory "<a href="
            http://www.bitkeeper.com/v2_logging/">Open
            Logging</a>" of your metadata (privacy loss) if used
            with multi-user access.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Had a history of gaining more restrictive conditions
            over time. E.g.: The licence initially provided that,
            if the company's Open Logging servers ceased to function
            for 180 days, the software would convert to GPL, but
            that provision was later withdrawn. Source code access
            was also withdrawn. The non-compete clause was added. A
            provision was added (and later removed) to allow
            BitMover to terminate the licences of any individuals
            or groups whose usage is deemed to have cost BitMover
            over US $20,000 in support costs.</p>

            <p>Consequently: (1) Publicly posted comments about
            BitKeeper were often outdated. (2) It was recommended to
            download the program and read its current licence
            agreement. (See slightly outdated licence analysis,
            copy <a href="
            http://www.mit.edu/afs/athena/user/x/i/xiphmont/Public/critique.html">
            1</a> <a href="
            http://www.taniwha.org/bitkeeper.html">2</a>, for
            which the author was unfortunately threatened with
            litigation.)</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Was subject to mandatory upgrading, per the licence's
            requirement, when new versions come out. There are
            compelling technical reasons why BitMover required
            this. However, it should be noted that replacement
            versions often introduced new licensing containing
            novel restrictions, such as the no-compete clause. (The
            point was not to portray this as somehow sinister: It was
            to prevent people from assuming they could keep using
            older versions, if they didn't like newer ones' terms of
            use.)</p>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Was encumbered by non-compete clause, <a href="
            http://lwn.net/Articles/12120/">http://lwn.net/Articles/12120/</a>.
            If you or your employer develops, produces, or
            [re]sells a "substantially similar" competing product,
            you may not use it. BitMover sometimes waived this
            restriction for particular users. BitMover had <a href="
            http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0210.0/1725.html">
            advised</a> some Linux kernel developers that they may
            not use the gratis-usage version, given their work on
            other SCMs. (They would have been obliged to buy the commercial
            version.)</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Required in latter versions that the the hosted
            repositories' source code contents be available (on
            BitMover request) via the BitKeeper access
            protocol.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Was <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/04-06-2005/0003335342&amp;EDATE=">announced</a> to be end-of-lifed in a company press release of April 6, 2005.</p>
