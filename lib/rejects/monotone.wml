Finally it identifies the various revisions of
files by their cryptographical digests, which makes it have some not 
so-user-friendly identifiers 
(such as: <tt>9fb38dee24fa6f6a7afc2bfd4b09f1dd65edcd79</tt>). Another potential
problem is that because the common history is only in the depot, it is possible
the repositories of the individual developers will become unsyncrhonized with
each other.
