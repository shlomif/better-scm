Bundle::Sites::BetterScm - A bundle to install CPAN modules used by the
Better-SCM site.

Version 0.2.0 - 2005-04-17

Bundled by: Shlomi Fish <https://www.shlomifish.org/>

This is not a module that people generally need to download
and install locally. This Bundle is meant to live on CPAN so
that people can use CPAN.pm magic to automagically download and
install modules.

The syntax for doing this would be something like:
$ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Sites::BetterScm'
